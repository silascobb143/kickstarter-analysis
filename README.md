# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
The Kickstarter analysis had us take a look at Louise's fundraising goals. For this project she wanted us to see what the relationship of launch dates and their funding goals are. We provided the results via pivot charts, line graphs, and various excel funcitons.
### Purpose
The purpose of us completing this project was to get a clearer idea of the percentage of outcomes that were either successful,failed, or canceled. This will allow Louise to know which fundraising goals goals she should focus on.
## Analysis and Challenges
When creating these two analysis I was able to work through most of it just by following the directions and steps listed. Having those as a guide along with using information from the training module helped solve any minor issues that I came across. Most of the fomulas that they asked us to use had already been covered earlier so I did not need to look into them any further. As for the couple of new ones I used the Hints to help work them out.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The Outcome Based on Launch Date analysis was able to give us insight on the "theater" success,failed, and cancled numbers. The Pivot Table for "theater" shows that the two months that have the highest successful campains are in May and June. So if Louise were to do another fundraiser for "theater" she would likely want to have that start in either May or June.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
On Outcomes Based on Goals I had to make a new sheet in excel. The directions were slightly more confusing on my first read but after going through them a couple of times I was able to properly transfer the correct data into the sheet.  This focused more on the goal amounts rather than the success month as in the first part.  It was able to show up what goal amounts under "plays" were most successful.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During this analysis I encounted a problem when trying to create the number of successful,failed, and canceled on our "Outcome Based on Goals" sheet. I could not get my fomula to produce the correct data. I found out after watching the Hint video several times that the reason my fomula was not working was because I was leaving out the = in the part where we need <=1000 etc. One link I had to visit was:

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The two most successful months or launch are in May and June.
2. December would be the worst month to launch as they had more failed/canceled than successful. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
If you are wanting to maximize your success rate then you should keep the goals less that $5000.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A couple of things that could limit this dataset are upcoming kickstarts that are desirable to fund. Another could be that in a kickstarter when making a donation you are limited of how much you can give.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Another great option to the the percentage of success rate would have been to use a pie chart.
